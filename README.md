Movie Night API-Fetch Demo w/ JavaScript

This website uses the IMDb API (https://imdb-api.com/api) to help the user search for movies by title, or use an advanced search mode that takes certain search parameters
to generate a list of results to choose from.

The API is accessed via JavaScript fetch requests, and the JSON results are handled to give easy-to-read output for the user.

The CSS and design scripts are a product of https://materializecss.com/.
